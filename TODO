; AnzuOS GOAL
; 16 bit RealMode OS, 1MB RAM is usable.
; Should work on an Sharp PC.
; The dream goal would be, being able to develop an application inside the os in c.
; Scope of the project is a very minimal version of MikeOS.

; Next Objective:
; Create a version of the backspace routine without printing 3 character (2 Backspace, 1 Space, Currently)
; Handle return character properly, set Cursor_X = 0, Increment Cursor_Y, etc..
; Seperate out the bootloader part, and have it locate the kernel and load it.


NOTES:
; The flp file seems not to be needed. (this was from the mikeOS tutorial)
